# What's Chrysalis?
Chrysalis is a general purpose, completely free and open source, MLP-themed Discord bot. I made this bot because I'm sick of using bots that charge you for everything.

# How to contribute
Any contribution is welcome! From adding GIFs to adding languages. You can also improve the code or even add new commands if you want. With your help, we can make this bot the only bot you'll need.

# How to build

Chrysalis is made with discord.js v13, so you will need Node.js 16.6 or higher to run it.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Install MongoDB in your server.
4. Make a copy of `.env_sample`, put your database details and your Discord token in it and rename it to `.env`.
5. Start the bot using `npm run dev`.
