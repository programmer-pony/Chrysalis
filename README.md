# What's Chrysalis?

Chrysalis is a general purpose, completely free and open source, MLP-themed Discord bot. I made this bot because I'm sick of proprietary bots that charge you for half of their features, and you probably are too. [Try Chrysalis today!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=797161820594634762&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

# How to contribute

Any contribution is welcome! From adding GIFs to adding new features.  

You can also help translating the bot and/or its [documentation](https://chrysalis-docs.programmerpony.com/). Chrysalis is currently available in English, Spanish and Italian, and the documentation is available in English and Spanish. PRs fixing typos are welcome too.  

With your help, we can make Chrysalis the only bot you'll ever need!

# How to build

###### Chrysalis is made with discord.js v13.6, so you will need Node.js 16.9 or higher to run it.

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. Install MongoDB on your server.
4. Make a copy of `.env_sample`, put your database details and your Discord token in it and rename it to `.env`.
5. Follow the instructions on `src/emojis.js` to make custom emojis work.
6. Start the bot using `npm run dev` (for development) or `npm start` (for production).
